            Newtonâ€™s Cradle - A physics phenomenon known as the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy is demonstrated here. The Torus shown in this piece symbolises
            OpenDAO as both the driver and vehicle of change for all participants within the ecosystem. By shifting and transmitting energy through to all parts of the DAO, we can
            maximise growth and momentum while preserving energy for key moments of high velocity wave action.

            Singularity - This work symbolises the coming together of numerous ideas and energies as they vibrate across spacetime connecting via networks, both physical and
            ethereal. It has the visual elements of molecular forms and alludes to synaptic hive mind activity as the particle lights up in various sectors before forming the
            OpenDAO torus insignia. Out of the chaos we find harmony, intention, focus and direction. Using decentralisation and distributed energy we find the building blocks for
            a better tomorrow, together.

            Disruptor - We celebrate the high energy disruptors that are energised and mobilised in shaking up the long held conventional ways. We all move at different rhythms and
            timescales, but in crucial moments we align and focus on our common goals. This piece acts as a signal beacon to all that heed the call for a more decentralised and
            shared world. The 3 spinning rings symbolise the energy, frequency and vibration that runs through all of us.
